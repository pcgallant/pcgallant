# 👋 Hi, I'm Patricia Gallant (most people call me Patty)
**Software/Systems Analyst • Educator • Automation & CI/CD Enthusiast**

I’m a technology-focused educator and former enterprise systems analyst now building a refreshed engineering portfolio focused on:

- **CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions)**
- **QA automation & testing frameworks**
- **Python scripting & internal tools**
- **Unity WebGL build tooling**
- **Documentation, developer enablement, and instructional tech**

I love designing workflows that make developers (and students!) faster, more confident, and more independent.
